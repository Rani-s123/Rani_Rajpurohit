What I Did in My Project :-

I developed a Bus Boarding Sequence Generator using FastAPI, Pandas, and HTML/JavaScript.
The goal was to generate a booking-wise boarding order that helps passengers board efficiently when there is only one front entry in the bus.

I designed the algorithm to calculate the distance of each seat (based on row letters A–D and seat numbers) and then sort the bookings so that passengers sitting at the back board first.

I built the backend API using FastAPI to handle CSV uploads and compute results using Pandas.
The frontend interface was made with HTML, CSS, and JS to display a clean, interactive table showing the final boarding order.

Finally, I tested the system with multiple input files to ensure accuracy and handled edge cases like multiple seats per booking and tie conditions.

✨ Key Things I Did

Created algorithm logic to calculate seat distance and sequence

Used FastAPI to build backend REST API

Processed CSV files using Pandas

Built a clean frontend UI with HTML/JS for file upload and result display

Added CORS, error handling, and sorting logic

Verified results with sample data and ensured realistic boarding order

🚀 Outcome

Generated accurate boarding sequences automatically

Reduced manual sorting or confusion

Built a fully working frontend + backend web system

Deployed and documented the project for demonstration
